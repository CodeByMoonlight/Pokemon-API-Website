  - React is used to build the dynamic and interactive user interface. It manages state efficiently and provides a smooth user experience.
- **Backend**: Express.js
  - Express.js is used to handle server-side logic, including API routes for CRUD operations and database interactions.
- **Database**: SQLite
  - SQLite is used to store custom Pokemon stories locally.
